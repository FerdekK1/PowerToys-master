# Community

The PowerToys team is extremely grateful to have the support of an amazing active community.  The work you do is incredibly important.  PowerToys wouldnâ€™t be near what it is without your help filing bugs, updating documentation, guiding the design, or writing features.  We want to say thanks and to recognize your work.  This is a living document dedicated to highlighting the high impact community members and their contributions.

Names are in alphabetical order based on first name.
